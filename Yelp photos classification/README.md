The capstone project is still in progress. 

Here is [the first version of slides](./Capstone_Project_slides.pdf).

A classifier using neural network is being built to perform classification on Yelp photos, 
which are composed of 5 categories: menu, food, drink, inside, and outside.

Up to now, transfer learning based on Imagenet classifier gives rise to 95.39% accuracy. 

More update is coming soon.
