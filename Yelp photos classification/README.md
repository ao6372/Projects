The capstone project is still in progress. 

Here is [the first version of slides](./Capstone Project.pdf).

A classifier using neural network is being built to perform classification on Yelp photos, 
which are composed on 5 classes: menu, food, drink, inside, and outside.

Up to now, transfer learning based on Imagenet classifier gives rise to 80% accuracy. 

More update is coming soon.
